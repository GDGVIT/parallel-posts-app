   <h2 align="center"> Parallel Posts App </h2>  
   <h4 align="center">  
   Every week the digital marketing team of DSC VIT has to upload numerous posts to reach out to the community. These posts usually with the same content have to be posted repetitively on all social media platforms. This task is tedious and unnecessary.  
    <br>  <br>
    Thus, to simplify this process we came up with this project, where the objective was to make a unified platform to facilitate parallel posts, i.e. the user will be able to post content to various social media by making one single request.
